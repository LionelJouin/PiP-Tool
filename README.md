# PiP-Tool (Picture In Picture tool)

PiP tool is a software to use the Picture in Picture mode on Windows. This feature allows you to watch content (video for example) in thumbnail format on the screen while continuing to use any other software on Windows.

To use this tool, select a window and the region of the window, then validate. A new window (Always on the top) will appear with the selected region. The software does not work yet with minimized windows (If you're watching a video, and you minimize the window, the video in the Picture in Picture mode will stop)

### Machine Learning ([ML.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/apps/machine-learning-and-ai/ml-dotnet))

Machine learning is used in this software to predict selected regions in order to simplify and speed up the usage of the PiP-Tool. 

There are no default data provided with this app, data are created and stored locally from your previous uses of this software. When you have validated a selected region to enter in Picture in Picture Mode, region' data are stored and the machine learning' model is improved.
